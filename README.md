# unistroke
A neural network unistroke symbol recognizer with the backpropagation algorithm

Install the Numpy and Scipy (used for the activation function) libraries with pip3. 

Run with python3 gui.py on Linux or python gui.py on Windows.

Load the sample .csv file to train the network with 0-9 digits and click Train. You can also create your own symbol training set.

After training is finished, set the program to recognition mode and draw symbols with your mouse with one stroke.
